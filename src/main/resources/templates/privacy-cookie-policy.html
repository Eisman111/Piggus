                                    As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies,
                                    which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience.
                                    This page describes what information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need
                                    to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being
                                    stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites functionality.<br><br>
                                    For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies.<br><br>
                                    <b>How We Use Cookies</b><br>
                                    We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there
                                    are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling
                                    the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave
                                    on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used
                                    to provide a service that you use.<br><br>
                                    <b>Disabling Cookies</b><br>
                                    You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser
                                    (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will
                                    affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling
                                    cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features
                                    of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.<br><br>
